	    <p class="main-heading"><b>Our Strength & Priorities</b></p>

		<p class="paragraph">Delivering the best healthcare possible is the number one focus of our organization and our physicians. Telehealth is our vehicle of healthcare delivery;<br> it does not change the standard of care. As such, the clinic personnel and patients we serve find that our quality of healthcare delivery is held to<br> the highest levels of satisfaction, which we consistently measure and monitor through patient and provider satisfaction surveys and peer evaluations.</p>


		<p class="second-heading"><b>Our Strength & Priorities</b></p>

			<p class="paragraph">Each Aarogya Kavach specialist is carefully selected for his or her medical expertise and sensitivity to the consumer experience. Our medical specialists<br> are fellowship-trained when applicable, with a focus on clinical medicine. They are licensed in the states in which their patients reside and are fully credentialed<br> with the facilities that Aarogya Kavach serves. A key distinguishing feature of Aarogya Kavach is that our organization trains and monitors<br> its medical specialists in delivery of Telehealth services.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The primary care centers with which we work are offered the opportunity to interview and agree upon the selection of their specialist(s). We offer flexible<br> scheduling times, a variety of clinical disciplines, and prompt response turnaround times to the centerâ€™s physician, staff, and patient needs.</p>

	<p class="paragraph" >Aarogya Kavach is continually expanding and evolving. Our success with recruiting physicians into our medical practice is due to our infrastructure,<br> our staff, and our focus on quality. We currently have more than 80 medical and behavioral health specialists and are willing to add specialties at the request <br> of our clients and partners.</p>
